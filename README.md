# Todo App 
I created this application to become familiar with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) framework, creating routes from scratch, and local containerization using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 

## Dependecy Management 
Dependencies are managed using pipenv. I chose to use pipenv over requirements.txt because by default requirements.txt does not specify versions. This can be an issue when the latest version of a package is installed and it is not backwards compatible. I have expiermented with using `pip freeze` to spciefy the versions of the packages. However, this solution easily becomes unmaintable when you have to worry about every version of every package, including sub-dependencies. Using pipenv you do not have to force extract versions. You can also specify packages for development environment and a production environment. A more eloquent explanation of pipenv can be found [here](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/#dependency-management-with-requirementstxt).
